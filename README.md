## Brendan Enrick (Brendoneus)

Hi there! 👋

My name is Brendan, and I am a nerd/geek. I've been programming since the late '90s and love seeing all of the things we as a community can build together! I train, mentor, and coach software development teams as my day job, and I make Videos and Code Live on Stream on the DevChatter YouTube and DevChatter Twitch Channels. I play board games, card games, tabletop games, console games, pc games, etc. I'm a father to two wonderful kikds and a husband to an amazing wife.
